This was one of my first games made for a game jam, and was submitted to the Games Den Quick jam in 2021. You play as a chef, but instead of a pantry you have a dungeon. You explore the procedurally generated dungeon to slay enemy monsters and collect ingredients to make into food orders for the restaurant.

One of the diversifiers for this jam, which I followed, was that we use art from these two asset packs by 0x72: [Dungeon Pack I](https://0x72.itch.io/16x16-dungeon-tileset) and [Dungeon Pack II](https://0x72.itch.io/dungeontileset-ii).
