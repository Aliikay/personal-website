Community Garden is a very simple game where you can plant plants in a shared garden online. There isn't a progression system or traditional gameplay, the game is just about planting plants with your friends in fun arrangements. This was a game made for the Global Game Jam 2023. It was made in 48 hours as a way for me to get familiarized with working with online multiplayer.

# Technical Write-up
The networking for this game was made using [Mirror](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/mirror-129321), which is a high-level networking library for Unity. It's very similar to [FishNet](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/fishnet-networking-evolved-207815) which we are using for [Slipstream](@/games/slipstream.md) so the learning I gained from this jam was able to carry over into later work.
