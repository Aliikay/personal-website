# About Me
Hi there! I'm Alikay, a game developer currently working at at studio I founded with three other peers, [Daisy Chain Games](https://daisychaingames.ca/) on our game [Slipstream](@/games/slipstream.md).

I'm primarily a game programmer, and I have experience in both Unity and Godot. I've tended to use Godot for personal projects since the Unity runtime fee, but Slipstream uses Unity and I used it before that, so I have experience in both.

I also work in other creative fields relating to game development. I occasionally do 3D modelling for my personal projects, both to use in 3D games and also to be rendered down into 2D sprites (like what was done for the SNES Donkey Kong Country games) to make up for my lack of traditional 2D art abilities. I also compose music for games, and was the main composer for [Spring Cleaning](@/games/spring-cleaning.md).

# About this Site
This website is a static site developed with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) and deployed on GitHub Pages. The source code for this website is available [at this repository](https://github.com/Aliikay/personal-website).

I decided to create my own theme and template for this website instead of using an existing one as an opportunity to get more in the weeds with Zola's template system. The colour scheme I chose is original, but takes significant inspiration from [Nyx8 Palette](https://lospec.com/palette-list/nyx8).

I made the initial design for the website in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), which is an open-source design program similar to Figma.

*This website, as well as all of my projects, has been created with **absolutely no AI**.*
