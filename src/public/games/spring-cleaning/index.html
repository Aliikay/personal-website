You have to platform, collect dust to grow and shrink, and dash to progress through the three levels to stop the "Earthshaker"!<p>On this game I was primarily a musician and sound effect designer, but I also implemented some features in the game myself. I created the credits sequence and implemented all the audio I made into the game myself. This worked out well for me, since I was able to implement the SFX I made in the way I had intended.<p>I was also the level designer for the game, which presented it's own challenges. Since the player is able to be any size in a very large range, I had to design levels that were mostly compatible with any size of player. We had intended for the player to intentionally shrink and grow at parts in order to make the platforming challenges easier, so I also included some sections that were very difficult when either large or small. Some of these points ended up being problematic for players however, since I did not tutorialize that players should be thinking about their size as a mechanic that interacts with the platforming enough. This is most prominent during the wall jump segment in the boss fight, which repeatedly came up as a pain point in playtesting, despite our attempts to make it more lenient.</div></div></div></div>
